            Coinpunk is a project to build the first fully open source, self-hosted DIY Bitcoin wallet service you can run on your own server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier this year, I started Coinpunk with a basic implementation that managed wallets on the server side. Since then, I have spent the summer rebuilding it from scratch to support a hybrid-wallet design that moves the encryption to your web browser, where the server can't touch it. It wasn't the easy route (the original server-based implementation only took a week), and there's plenty of new problems (HTML5 is.. still pretty wild west), but it was the route I thought was right for the project, and also for the future of Bitcoin. <strong>We need web wallet solutions that are simple and easy to use, but also build upon Bitcoin's biggest strength: decentralization</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe strongly in the notion that <strong>you should be able to truly control your own money. Not corporations, not banks (central or private), you.</strong> That means you control your private keys, and can run the wallet on your own server if you choose to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm feeling pretty good about the state of the code now, so I'm announcing that <strong>Coinpunk is now in beta</strong>. It works, and I've never lost money using it in production. But because it's dealing with real money, <strong>I need developer help to test it</strong>. I'm asking for developers (especially those proficient with client-side HTML5/JS and node.js) to start playing with it, so we can make sure we've stamped out the bugs, code smells, and potential issues before doing a formal release. It defaults to <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet">Testnet Mode</a> by default, so you can try it out without losing real Bitcoins!
          </p>

          <p>
            I also want to announce that <strong>I am offering 3 bounties of 0.20 BTC each (~$40) for anyone that finds and fixes (via pull request) any bugs/code issues that potentially cause wallet data loss, are a major security bug in the Coinpunk wallet code (coinpunk/models/wallet.js), bitcoinjs-lib, or in the random number generation code</strong>. If you would like help add more bounties for developers, you can send donations to this address, and I will use them to make bounties for Coinpunk development: <strong>13PQxWUfjo1z1Y2PTL7STodBZ5V6ZsLb9M</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Going forward, I have many other features I want to add. I want to provide better mobile support, build an internationalization framework, and put together an API for developers. But it's useful today as-is, so I'm going to defer these features to a future release so developers can start getting their feet wet.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to thank everyone at the <a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org">Bitcoin Foundation</a> for providing me with a grant to allow me to work on this full time for the summer. I also want to thank <a href="http://torguard.net">TorGuard</a>, the <a href="http://www.bitcoindf.org">Bitcoin Development Fund</a>, and the many others that have contributed to the project. I also want to thank the many developers that wrote the open source code that this project would not have been possible without, especially <a href="https://github.com/justmoon">Stefan Thomas</a> for his work on <a href="http://github.com/bitcoinjs">BitcoinJS</a>, the great team at <a href="https://bitpay.com">BitPay</a>, and many others.
